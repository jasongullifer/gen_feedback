#  Generate Student Feedback Forms (gen_feedback.py)

Generate student feedback sheets (for Omnivox/Lea). Omnivox expects the
student ID numbers to be contained in the filename. This program uses a
delimited text file containing student names and ids to create the text
feedback files. It can also instead create multiple copies of a template file,
following the naming conventions (e.g., for making copies of a rubric that can
be uploaded as  student feebdack).
